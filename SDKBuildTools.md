Android SDK Build-Tools is a component of the Android SDK required for building Android apps. It's installed in the <sdk>/build-tools/ directory.

You should always keep your Build Tools component updated by downloading the latest version using the Android SDK Manager. If you're using Android plugin for Gradle 3.0.0 or higher, your project automatically uses a default version of the build tools that the plugin specifies.
